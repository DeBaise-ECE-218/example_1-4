### Project Description
This project focuses on the creation of a windshield wiper control system for modern vehicles, utilizing a Nucleo board. The system encompasses a range of sensors and inputs including a driver seat occupancy sensor, an ignition push button, a blue indicator LED, a wiper mode selector (HI, LO, INT, OFF), an intermittent delay time selector (SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG), and a windshield wiper motor. This setup aims to provide precise control over the vehicle's windshield wipers based on various operational modes and conditions.

The windshield wiper subsystem is designed to operate in four distinct modes: HI (high speed), LO (low speed), INT (intermittent), and OFF. The system also features a user display for indicating the current wiper setting. In HI and LO modes, the wipers move continuously between 0 degrees and a maximum angle (around 67 degrees) at designated speeds. The INT mode introduces a selectable delay at the 0-degree position, allowing for cycles with periods of 3, 6, or 8 seconds. The OFF mode ensures the wipers remain stationary.

### Testing

**Ignition Subsystem**
| Specification                                                                                                                             | Result | Comments                                                                                                                              |

| Start the engine (i.e., light the blue LED) while the driverâ€™s seat is occupied and when the ignition button is pushed and then released. | Pass   | Reliably starts the engine and indicates it only when the driver has sat down and only when the user button is released               |
| Keep the engine running even if the driver should exit the vehicle.                                                                       | Pass   | Upon the driver leaving (I.e. the push button sensor is relieved), the engine continues to run                                        |
| When the engine is running, stop the engine when the ignition button is pushed and then released (per the project criteria)               | Pass   |  If the engine is currently running (as indicated by the blue LED) and the user presses and releases the button, the engine turns off |

| If the engine is running, and the user selects: HI, run the wipers at high speed; LO, run the wipers at low speed; INT, run the wipers intermittently with the selected delay; OFF, stop all wiper movement.                                     | Pass   | Wipers operate correctly in all modes with respect to the engine state and user selection. Delay times for INT mode are accurately followed.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Display the selected mode, including the delay time selection (SHORT, MEDIUM, or LONG) for intermittent mode on the user display.                                                                                                               | Pass   | The user display correctly shows the current wiper mode and, in INT mode, the selected delay time. Furthermore, it will only be displayed while the engine is running.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| If the wiper mode selector is turned to OFF, or the engine is turned off, then complete the current cycle and return the wipers to 0 degrees if moving; if hesitating in INT mode, remain stationary.                                           | Pass   | Wipers complete their current cycle before stopping if the engine is turned off or the selector is moved to OFF. In INT mode, wipers pause as expected.                                                                                                                                        |
